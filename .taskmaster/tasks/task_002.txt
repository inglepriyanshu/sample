# Title: Configure tRPC with Tanstack React Query
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up tRPC for API communication and integrate Tanstack React Query for data fetching.
# Details:
Install `@trpc/server`, `@trpc/client`, `@trpc/next`, and `@tanstack/react-query`. Configure tRPC routers and procedures. Set up the tRPC client in the frontend. Ensure proper type safety with TypeScript.

# Test Strategy:
Test basic tRPC procedures (e.g., a simple ping-pong endpoint) to verify communication between client and server.
