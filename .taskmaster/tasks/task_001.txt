# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Next.js Project with App Router
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a Next.js 14+ project with App Router and configure the basic project structure.
# Details:
Use `create-next-app` to initialize the project with TypeScript. Configure the App Router for routing. Set up the basic folder structure (e.g., `app/`, `public/`, `styles/`). Install required dependencies like `next`, `react`, and `react-dom`.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the project runs locally with `npm run dev` and the default Next.js page loads correctly.
